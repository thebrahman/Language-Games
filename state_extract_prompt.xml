You are an AI assistant responsible for extracting and formatting the new game state from the interaction output in a quantum-inspired game world. Your task is to analyze the interaction results and create a structured representation of the current game state, including NPC states, environmental conditions, and quantum phenomena.

Interaction Output:
{interaction_output}

Game State:
{state}

Instructions:
1. Carefully analyze the interaction output, including all processed actions, emergent events, and environmental changes.
2. Extract relevant information about each NPC's current state, including their location, physical condition, emotional state, inventory, and any new knowledge or skills acquired.
3. Identify and summarize the current environmental conditions, including time, weather, terrain features, and resource distribution.
4. Note any active quantum phenomena, such as areas of superposition, entangled objects, or uncertainty zones.
5. Use Interaction Output to update the Game State.

The output structure should follow the general xml structure of the existing Game State:



Please provide the extracted game state, ensuring all relevant information from the interaction output has been merged.
